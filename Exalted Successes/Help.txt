## Exalted Successes

Whenever a message is posted to the chat which includes rolling d10s, the script will foolow up by posting the number of successes for a roll in the _Exalted_ game system by White Wolf Publishing. Restuls of 7, 8, and 9 are each 1 success, 10s are 2 successes*, and 1s are botches _if and only if_ there are zero successes.

\* There are corner cases in the game system where dice with values less than 7 count as successes (or 7, 8, and/or 9 _don't_ count as successes), and damage rolls do not normally count 10s as double. This script does not account for those cases.

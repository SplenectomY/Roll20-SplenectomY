## Flight

Adds copies of the `fluffy-wing` status icon to the selected tokens with numbers indicating how high the token is flying.

Use `!fly height` (where _height_ is a number) while selecting one or more tokens. If _height_ is 0 or is omitted, the wings will be removed. Any integer number can be used, although any digits of the number which are 0 will show up as wings without a number.

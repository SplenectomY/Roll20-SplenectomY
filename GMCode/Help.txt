To use: (GMC = Game Master Code)
!gmcodehelp ~ A quick reference to the functions.
!gencode YOURCODEHERE ~ Generates a random GMC. Generates a random code anyway if no code currently exists.
!clearcode YOURCODEHERE ~ Clears the current GMC. Generates a random if none is present.
!custcode YOURCODEHERE NEWCODEHERE ~ Changes the GMC to a custom one.

The script often logs the GMC. Don't want the GM losing it eh?

For coders:
The variable to access the code is "state.gmcode".
Example
if (message[1] != state.gmcode && state.gmcode != null)
{
   CODE HERE
}

It is recommended you message the player if the GMC input is incorrect OR one does not exist.
